# Ticket Management (Vue)

A Vue 3 + Vite demo app modeled after a React example. Uses localStorage as a simple backend for tickets and a minimal Toast system.

Quick start:

```bash
cd ticket-management-vue
npm install
npm run dev
```

Notes:

- This scaffold includes basic pages and components (Landing, Login, Signup, Dashboard, Tickets).
- Tailwind CSS is configured via PostCSS.
- Authentication is mocked via localStorage.
